# 🛒 Shopever – Full Stack E-Commerce Web Application

Shopever is a fully functional full-stack e-commerce web application developed to deliver a seamless online shopping experience for users and a powerful management system for administrators.
The application is designed using modern web technologies with a clear separation between user interface, admin dashboard, and backend services to ensure scalability, security, and maintainability.

## 📖 Project Description

The Shopever platform enables customers to browse products, manage carts, and place orders through an intuitive user interface.
An independent admin panel is provided for administrators to manage products, monitor orders, and maintain overall system control.
The backend API serves as the core of the application, handling authentication, business logic, and database communication.

This project follows real-world industry practices and demonstrates end-to-end full-stack development.
